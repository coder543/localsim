`localsim` is a Rust program designed to visualize and simulate nearby space. Current focus is on 3D plotting of stars in the HYG database, but I would eventually like for `localsim` to include the planets, moons, and other notable objects in our solar system.

HYG database came from [here](https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database).
